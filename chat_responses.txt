You: Give me the lines of poem "Bower".

ChatGPT: Certainly! Here are the lines from the poem titled "Bower":

My aching blue buds my sinews empower –
when you are not looking,
when you are naked sleeping
up there – to launch me into your misty bower.

Think not that I must climb the turret tower,
or fret at openings barred with wrought iron grille,
for I can blink to naught all hindrance at will
and nest upon your balcony sill –
a groin-glowing eager bower.

Blast my desire for you, little flower!
as you innocently roll from side to side,
forever in my dreams a maiden bride
and to mischief at dawn always a bower.

Title: Old Game

Rain washes blood away and
Time turns pain into a child’s play.
It’s all part of the old game
gods play with only one aim:
to laugh and joke and be gay
to their mortal heart’s content.


Title: Last Wish

If I could choose my last day on earth,
I would like it to be a rainy day
And have my last breath carried away
By the sound it makes water
Running from the roof
On an empty can beneath my window.

Title: How nice!

How nice to sit in this cozy
and clamoring coffee shop,
to sip one's steaming
Greek coffee in a little white cup,
knowing and not knowing that
this shop, this happy ambience
of laughter and clatter
and all that I see and don't see will
one day pass
into the dusty chest of memories!
How nice, that shop!
